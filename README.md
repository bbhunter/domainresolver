# domainresolver
A bash based tool to test if the domains/subdomains on the given file resolves and then save the output.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Description:
As we all bughunters always use different tools to collect the list of domains/subdomains while doing our recon. 
Sometimes we get get a huge list which might also include the domains/subdomains which do not resolve and to verify manually by going through each and every domain is a very painful work. So I came with an idea to create a script that does that heavy work for you using bash which is also a part of my learning process on bash. 
Now all you need to do is use this bash script on your list and then let it show it's magic and give you a list of resolving domains and you can then run your favourite screenshot tool like webscreenshot to run on that file to get see what's on those domains.
